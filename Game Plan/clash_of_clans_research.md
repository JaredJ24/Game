# Clash of Clans Research Notes

## Game Overview
Clash of Clans is a strategy mobile game developed by Supercell that combines base building, resource management, and combat. Players build and defend their village while training troops to attack other players' villages.

## Core Mechanics

### Core Loop
The game's core loop consists of three major interconnected parts:
1. **Collecting Resources**: Automated farming of Coins and Elixir
2. **Building & Training**: Using resources to construct buildings and train troops
3. **Battling**: Using troops to attack other villages and earn resources/trophies

### Resource System
- **Dual Currency**: Coins and Elixir as soft currencies
- **Automated Production**: Resources generate automatically over time
- **Collection Caps**: Resource buildings have maximum capacity limits
- **Upgrade Path**: Players can upgrade resource buildings to increase production and capacity
- **Premium Currency**: Gems can be purchased with real money to speed up processes

### Building & Training Mechanics
- **Interdependent Economy**: Building upgrades require resources from different production facilities
- **Time-Based Progression**: All construction and upgrades take time to complete
- **Builder Limitation**: Limited number of simultaneous constructions (2 by default)
- **Exponential Scaling**: Both cost and time increase exponentially with building levels
- **Troop Training**: Troops cost Elixir and time to produce, with better troops requiring more of both

### Combat System
- **Troop Deployment**: Players strategically place troops around enemy bases
- **Consumable Units**: All deployed troops are consumed after battle, regardless of outcome
- **Objective-Based**: Success measured by destruction percentage and resource acquisition
- **Trophy System**: Competitive ranking based on attack/defense success

### Progression System
- **Headquarters (Town Hall) Gating**: Building levels capped by Town Hall level
- **Visual Transformation**: Village visually evolves as player progresses
- **Achievement System**: Rewards for completing specific objectives
- **Single-Player Campaign**: Progressive PvE missions alongside PvP content

## Monetization Approach

### Primary Monetization Mechanics
- **Builder Limitation**: Additional builders cost premium currency (gems)
- **Time Acceleration**: Players can pay to skip waiting times
- **Resource Purchases**: Direct purchase of resources with premium currency
- **Whale-Based Model**: Prices increase as game progresses, targeting high-spending players

### Monetization Psychology
- **Progress Acceleration**: Payments don't provide exclusive power, just faster progress
- **Emotional Investment**: Players become attached to their village, increasing willingness to spend
- **Competitive Pressure**: PvP elements create desire to progress faster
- **Sunk Cost Mechanism**: The more time invested, the more willing players are to spend

## Unique Elements for Synthesis

1. **Interdependent Economy**: Resources and buildings form a web of dependencies that create natural progression gates

2. **Builder Limitation**: Simple but effective monetization through limiting simultaneous actions

3. **Automated Resource Generation**: Encourages regular session patterns without requiring constant attention

4. **Visual Progression**: Clear visual feedback on progress creates satisfaction and attachment

5. **Exponential Scaling**: Creates natural slowdown that extends game lifetime and monetization opportunities

## Potential Applications to Our Game Design

- Consider implementing an interdependent economy where different resources are required for different aspects of progression
- Explore limiting simultaneous actions as a soft monetization approach
- Implement automated resource generation with collection caps to encourage regular play sessions
- Create clear visual progression to reinforce player achievement
- Design exponential scaling systems that create natural monetization opportunities without feeling exploitative
