# Clash Royale Research Notes

## Game Overview
Clash Royale is a real-time strategy card game developed by Supercell that combines elements of collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena. It features synchronous PvP battles using cards representing troops, buildings, and spells from the Clash of Clans universe.

## Core Mechanics

### Core Loop
The game's core loop consists of two main components:
1. **Battle**: Synchronous PvP matches where players deploy cards strategically
2. **Meta-Game**: Collecting, upgrading, and building decks of cards

The loop is driven by four key elements:
- Win battles to earn Trophies
- Trophies unlock new Arenas (league tiers)
- Arenas determine the quality of rewards
- Chests from victories provide cards and resources for upgrades

### Battle System
- **Arena Layout**: Two lanes with three towers (two Crown Towers and one King Tower)
- **Victory Conditions**: Destroy more towers than opponent within time limit, or destroy the central King Tower for instant victory
- **Elixir Resource**: Regenerates over time and is spent to deploy cards
- **Card Deployment**: Players strategically place cards on the battlefield
- **Match Duration**: 3-minute matches with 1-minute overtime if tied
- **Crown System**: Each tower destroyed earns one Crown, with three Crowns maximum

### Card Collection
- **Card Acquisition**: Cards obtained primarily through Chests won from battles
- **Chest System**: Different chest types with varying unlock times (3-8 hours)
- **Limited Chest Slots**: Players can hold maximum of four Chests, creating wait times
- **Card Rarity Tiers**: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary cards with increasing power and scarcity
- **Upgrade System**: Cards require duplicates and Gold to level up

### Progression System
- **Trophy-Based Matchmaking**: Players matched based on Trophy count
- **Arena Progression**: Higher Arenas unlock new cards and better rewards
- **Player Level**: Determined by card upgrades, affects tower health
- **XP System**: Card upgrades provide XP to increase Player Level

## Monetization Approach

### Primary Monetization Mechanics
- **Chest Timers**: Premium currency (Gems) can skip waiting times for chest unlocks
- **Card Purchases**: Direct purchase of cards in the shop
- **Gold Shortage**: Upgrading cards requires increasing amounts of Gold, creating a resource pinch
- **Battle Pass**: Season-based subscription offering enhanced rewards
- **Special Offers**: Limited-time bundles in the shop

### Monetization Psychology
- **Impatience Monetization**: Waiting times create incentive to spend
- **Collection Completion**: Desire to collect and upgrade all cards
- **Competitive Advantage**: Higher level cards provide advantage in battles
- **Positive Return Sessions**: Chest unlocks create positive experiences when returning to the game

## Unique Elements for Synthesis

1. **Synchronous PvP Focus**: Real-time battles as the core engagement mechanic rather than asynchronous raids

2. **Transparent Progression**: Clear path from winning battles to earning rewards to upgrading cards

3. **Chest Slot Limitation**: Creates natural session breaks and return triggers

4. **Arena-Based Content Gating**: Progression tied to competitive success rather than grinding

5. **Card Upgrade System**: Creates demand for duplicate cards rather than just new cards

## Potential Applications to Our Game Design

- Consider implementing real-time PvP as a core engagement mechanic
- Explore a chest/reward system that creates natural session breaks and return triggers
- Design a progression system tied to competitive success rather than grinding
- Create a card/troop upgrade system that makes duplicates valuable
- Implement a league/arena system that gates content and rewards based on skill level
