# Breaking Down the Game Design Document

To efficiently complete the 60-page dense academic document, I'll break it down into these manageable sections:

1. Executive Summary & Vision (5 pages)
2. Game Mechanics & Combat System (15 pages)
3. Troop & Backpack Systems (10 pages)
4. World Design & Boss Encounters (10 pages)
5. Narrative & Storytelling (8 pages)
6. Monetization & Technical Implementation (7 pages)
7. Development Roadmap & Conclusion (5 pages)

I'll transform each section into dense academic prose, then compile them into the final document.
