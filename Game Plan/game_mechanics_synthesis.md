# Game Mechanics Synthesis

## Core Concept: "Pocket Tactics"

A minimalistic gacha fighting game that combines grid-based tactical combat with backpack customization and episodic spy adventure storytelling. The game embodies the "Apple of game development" philosophy by focusing on elegant simplicity with hidden depth, intuitive user experience, and strategic minimalism.

## Key Mechanics Synthesis

### 1. Dynamic Grid Combat (from Clash Mini + Into the Breach)
- **3x3 Grid System**: Player character occupies the center position with 8 surrounding cells for troop deployment
- **Rotatable Grid**: The grid follows the player's position and orientation, maintaining tactical integrity
- **Telegraphed Actions**: Enemy intentions are clearly displayed before they act, turning combat into a puzzle-like experience
- **Positional Strategy**: Troop placement and positioning are crucial for success
- **Environmental Interactions**: Grid cells can change type based on player actions or environmental factors

### 2. Backpack Customization (from DokeV + Genshin Impact)
- **Backpack as Character**: The backpack serves as both equipment and companion, granting unique abilities and housing troops
- **Distinct Backpack Types**: Each backpack has a unique deployment pattern and special abilities
  - Heavy Backpack: Deploys in a "+" pattern, focuses on defense and control
  - Tech Backpack: Deploys in an "X" pattern, emphasizes ranged attacks and utility
  - Stealth Backpack: Deploys in a circular pattern, specializes in mobility and surprise tactics
