# Genshin Impact Research Notes

## Game Overview
Genshin Impact is a gacha-based, open-world RPG developed and published by Chinese game development studio miHoYo. The game combines open-world exploration with character collection through a gacha system, and features episodic storytelling across different themed regions.

## Key Features

### Gacha Economy
- Players use in-game currency (Primogems) to make "wishes" for a chance to obtain characters and weapons
- Low probability rates for rare characters (5-star characters have approximately 0.6% drop rate)
- Pity system guarantees a 5-star item every 90 wishes
- Monetization through direct purchase of premium currency
- Cultural differences in reception - more accepted in Asian markets, sometimes controversial in Western markets
- Transparent disclosure of probability rates
- Mix of free and premium currencies allows F2P players to participate
- Limited-time banners create FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and drive spending

### Open-World Episodic Storytelling
- Large open world (Teyvat) divided into distinct regions, each with unique cultural inspirations
- Each region represents a different element and has its own Archon (deity)
- Story unfolds episodically as new regions are released over time
- Main storyline (Archon Quests) progresses through each region sequentially
- Character-specific story quests provide deeper lore and character development
- World quests and hidden stories encourage exploration
- Environmental storytelling through landmarks, ruins, and artifacts
- Seasonal events add temporary content and story elements
- Regions have distinct visual identity, music, and cultural references

### Cultural Elements
- Each region draws inspiration from real-world cultures:
  - Mondstadt: European/German inspiration
  - Liyue: Chinese inspiration with traditional architecture and mythology
  - Inazuma: Japanese inspiration
  - Sumeru: Middle Eastern and South Asian inspiration
  - Fontaine: French/Steampunk inspiration
- Cultural elements reflected in architecture, music, character design, and storylines
- Seasonal events often tied to real-world cultural celebrations (e.g., Lantern Rite for Chinese New Year)

### Progression Systems
- Adventure Rank system gates content and rewards
- Character leveling through experience, ascension materials, and talent upgrades
- Artifact system for equipment customization
- Reputation systems in each region
- Battle Pass for seasonal rewards
- Daily commissions and resin (energy) system to encourage regular play
