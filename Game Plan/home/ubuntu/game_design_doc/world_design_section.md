# World Design

## Overview

The world design of Pocket Tactics creates distinct, thematic environments for players to explore, each with unique challenges, enemies, and narrative elements. The game uses a hub-based structure with teleportation between worlds, allowing for focused, high-quality environments rather than a single continuous open world.

## World Structure

Pocket Tactics uses a hub-based design where players can teleport between distinct worlds from a central headquarters. This approach allows for:

1. Focused, high-quality environments with distinct themes
2. Clear progression paths through increasingly challenging worlds
3. Repeatable content for grinding and resource collection
4. Episodic storytelling with each world contributing to the overall narrative

## Fight Zones

A key mechanic in Pocket Tactics is the concept of "Fight Zones" - designated areas within each world where combat takes place:

- When a player enters a Fight Zone, troops automatically emerge from their backpack
- The 3x3 grid is activated, centered on the player's position
- Troops are positioned according to the pre-set configuration determined at headquarters
- When the player leaves the Fight Zone, troops return to the backpack
- This creates a seamless transition between exploration and combat

Fight Zones come in various types:
- Standard enemy zones with regular opponents
- Mini-boss arenas for more challenging encounters
- World boss lairs for major challenges
- Ultimate boss sanctuaries for the most difficult fights
- PvP arenas for player-versus-player combat
- Co-op challenge zones for multiplayer experiences
