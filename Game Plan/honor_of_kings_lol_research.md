# Honor of Kings/League of Legends Research Notes

## Game Overview
Honor of Kings (also known as Arena of Valor internationally) is a popular mobile MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game developed by TiMi Studio Group and published by Tencent Games. It shares many similarities with League of Legends, which is a PC-based MOBA developed by Riot Games. Both games focus on team-based competitive gameplay with an emphasis on strategic team compositions and synergies.

## Key Features

### Team Synergies
- Teams typically consist of 5 players with different roles (Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Marksman, Support)
- Successful teams balance these roles to create effective team compositions
- Player synergy is crucial - teams with experienced players who understand each other's playstyles perform better
- Character abilities are designed to complement each other, creating powerful combinations when used together
- Teams must coordinate their movements, objective control, and teamfight positioning

### Competitive Balance
- Regular balance patches adjust character strengths to maintain competitive integrity
- Meta shifts occur as certain team compositions become more or less effective
- Professional teams adapt strategies based on current meta and opponent tendencies
- Tournament formats (like the Honor of Kings Invitational) showcase high-level competitive play
- Handicap systems for tournament play help prevent snowballing (where early advantages become insurmountable)

### Character Design
- Diverse roster of characters with unique abilities and playstyles
- Characters are categorized into different roles with specific functions in team compositions
- Each character has strengths, weaknesses, and counter-matchups
- Character abilities are designed to create meaningful strategic choices
- Visual design clearly communicates character role and function

### Progression Systems
- Ranked ladder system that matches players of similar skill levels
- Seasonal competitive structure with rewards for achievement
- Character mastery systems that reward dedication to specific characters
- Cosmetic rewards that showcase player accomplishments
- Tournament circuits that culminate in championship events

## Elements to Incorporate in Our Game Design

1. **Role-Based Team Composition**
   - Adapt the role-based team structure to our grid-based tactical system
   - Create troop types that fulfill specific tactical roles (Tank, Damage, Support, Control)
   - Design backpack types that complement different troop compositions

2. **Ability Synergies**
   - Design troop abilities that create powerful combinations when used together
   - Implement elemental or type-based interactions between troops
   - Create "synergy bonuses" when certain troop combinations are deployed

3. **Competitive Balance Framework**
   - Develop a robust balance testing methodology
   - Plan for regular balance updates based on player data and feedback
   - Create a meta that rewards strategic depth without becoming stagnant

4. **Accessible Depth**
   - Design systems that are easy to understand but difficult to master
   - Create clear visual language for troop roles and abilities
   - Implement tutorials and progression systems that gradually introduce complexity

5. **Tournament Structure**
   - Design competitive formats that showcase strategic depth
   - Implement anti-snowball mechanics to keep matches exciting
   - Create spectator tools that make competitive play engaging to watch
