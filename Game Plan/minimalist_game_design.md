# Minimalist Game Design Research Notes

## Monument Valley

### Key Design Elements
- Clean, minimalist visual aesthetic with geometric shapes and optical illusions
- Simple, intuitive touch controls that require no tutorial
- Progressive complexity in puzzle design without cluttering the interface
- Emotional storytelling through visual design rather than extensive dialogue
- Short, focused gameplay sessions perfect for mobile experience
- Architectural inspiration creates unique gameplay mechanics
- Limited color palette that changes with each level to create distinct moods

### Success Factors
- Merges artistic beauty with puzzle mechanics
- Creates depth through spatial reasoning rather than complex systems
- Focuses on player experience and emotional journey
- Removes all unnecessary elements to highlight core mechanics
- Uses visual design to guide player attention
- Creates memorable moments through simplicity

## Into the Breach

### Key Design Elements
- Grid-based tactical gameplay on small 8x8 boards
- Perfect information system where all enemy moves are telegraphed
- Limited unit count (3 mechs) with distinct abilities
- Turn-based gameplay with emphasis on positioning and prediction
- Roguelike elements with procedurally generated missions
- Clear visual language that communicates game state at a glance
- Focus on preventing damage rather than dealing it

### Success Factors
- Creates deep tactical gameplay with minimal components
- Turns combat into puzzle-like scenarios with multiple solutions
- Makes each decision meaningful due to limited actions per turn
- Provides clear feedback on consequences of player actions
- Balances accessibility with strategic depth
- Creates replayability through procedural generation and unlockable content
- Focuses on a few core mechanics executed perfectly

## Common Elements in Successful Minimalist Games

1. **Clarity of Purpose**
   - Each game element serves a specific function
   - Core mechanics are immediately understandable
   - Visual design supports gameplay rather than distracting from it

2. **Depth Through Constraints**
   - Limited options create meaningful decisions
   - Simple rules that create complex emergent gameplay
   - Strategic depth achieved through interaction of basic systems

3. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Easy to learn, difficult to master
   - New elements introduced gradually
   - Complexity emerges from combinations rather than new rules

4. **Intuitive Feedback**
   - Clear visual and audio cues
   - Immediate response to player actions
   - Consistent rules and behaviors

5. **Focused Experience**
   - Removal of unnecessary features
   - Every element contributes to the core experience
   - Attention to pacing and session length

## Application to Our Game Design

- Create a grid-based combat system with clear visual language
- Limit the number of units/troops to focus on meaningful tactical decisions
- Use a clean, minimalist UI that highlights important information
- Develop a consistent visual language for abilities and interactions
- Focus on perfecting core mechanics rather than adding numerous features
- Create depth through the interaction of simple systems
- Design for short, satisfying gameplay sessions
- Use visual design to guide player attention and create emotional connection
