# Executive Summary

## Vision Statement

Pocket Tactics: Backpack Heroes is a minimalist tactical gacha game where every move tells a story, designed for players who crave strategy without clutter. The game embodies the "Apple of game development" philosophyâ€”prioritizing elegance, simplicity, and intuitive user experience while hiding complex systems beneath a polished surface.

By synthesizing the best elements from DokeV (whimsical exploration), Honor of Kings World/League of Legends (team synergies, competitive balance), Genshin Impact (gacha economy, open-world episodic storytelling), and Clash Mini (grid-based tactics), Pocket Tactics creates a fresh experience that stands apart from competitors through strategic minimalism.

## Unique Selling Propositions

### Dynamic Grid Combat
A tactical 3x3 grid battle system where positioning, terrain manipulation, and troop synergies create deep strategic gameplay. Each cell on the grid can contain different terrain types that affect troop performance, creating a constantly evolving battlefield.

### Backpack-as-a-Character
The player's backpack serves as both equipment and companion, with customizable features, upgradable abilities, and a distinct personality that develops throughout the adventure. The backpack is the source from which troops are deployed during combat.

### Nostalgia-Driven Progression
Players unlock abilities by collecting "Memory Fragments" tied to 90s/00s pop culture, powering the revolutionary "Nostalgia Meter" that enhances combat abilities based on childhood memories unlocked via mini-games.

### Dual-Layered Storytelling
A narrative that works on two levels: a surface-level Spy Kids-style adventure accessible to younger players, with a hidden layer of complex lore, ARG-style puzzles, and a darker conspiracy narrative for adult players to discover.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Strategic mobile gamers (25-40) who enjoy depth but have limited time
- **Secondary**: Collectors who enjoy gacha systems and character progression
- **Tertiary**: Narrative explorers who appreciate layered storytelling and world-building

## Business Model

Pocket Tactics employs a "Gacha 2.0" system with transparent rates and fair play principles. The core monetization comes from cosmetic elements (backpack skins, visual effects) and "Story Tokens" that unlock additional lore, while troops are primarily earned through gameplay. The player-driven economy allows for skin trading with a "Toy Box" twist, where duplicate troops can be traded as "action figures."

## Technical Feasibility

The game is designed to be fully executable in modern engines (Unreal/Unity/Roblox) with features prioritized for medium-scale development teams. The modular design allows for rapid prototyping and iteration, with AI tools supporting content generation for troop abilities and texture synthesis.

# Core Game Concept

## Game Pillars

### Tactical Grid Combat
The heart of the gameplay experience is the 3x3 grid combat system where players deploy troops from their backpack to battle enemies. The grid features dynamic terrain that changes based on troop abilities and player actions, creating a constantly evolving tactical puzzle.

### Backpack Customization
Players express themselves through their backpack, which serves as both their avatar and the source of their troops. Backpacks can be customized with different frames, processors, power sources, and interfaces that affect gameplay and aesthetics.

### Episodic Spy Adventure
The game world is divided into distinct themed regions that players can teleport between, each with its own narrative arc, challenges, and bosses. The overarching story follows the player as a recruit in a secret organization of Backpack Heroes.

# Troop System

## Overview

Troops are the collectible units that players deploy on the 3x3 grid during combat. Each troop occupies exactly 1 cell on the grid but has different deployment costs based on their power level and abilities. This resource management system is inspired by Clash of Clans' housing space and Clash Royale's elixir system, creating strategic depth in troop selection and deployment.

## Deployment System

### Energy Cost
- Each troop requires a specific amount of Energy to deploy
- Energy regenerates over time during battle (similar to Clash Royale's elixir)
- More powerful troops cost more Energy
- Strategic decisions must be made about deploying fewer powerful troops or more weaker troops

### Squad Capacity
- Players have a limited Squad Capacity for each battle (similar to Clash of Clans' housing space)
- Each troop takes up a certain amount of Squad Capacity
- More powerful troops require more Squad Capacity
- Squad Capacity can be increased through progression and backpack upgrades

## Troop Affinities

### Fire Affinity
- Offensive-focused troops with high damage
- Creates and benefits from fire terrain
- Strong against Nature, weak against Water

### Water Affinity
