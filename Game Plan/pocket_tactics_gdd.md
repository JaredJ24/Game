# 1. Executive Summary

## Vision Statement

"Pocket Tactics is a minimalist tactical gacha game where every move tells a story, designed for players who crave strategy without clutter."

Pocket Tactics embodies the "Apple of game development" philosophy by prioritizing elegance, simplicity, and intuitive user experience while maintaining strategic depth. The game fuses tactical grid-based combat with backpack customization and episodic spy adventure storytelling, creating a unique experience that appeals to both casual and hardcore players.

Like Apple's approach to product design, Pocket Tactics strips away unnecessary complexity to focus on what truly matters: meaningful player decisions, emotional connection to characters, and a sense of discovery. Every feature serves a purpose, every interaction feels natural, and every visual element communicates function.

## Unique Selling Points

### Dynamic Grid Combat
A rotatable 3x3 grid where positioning alters terrain and creates strategic opportunities. The player character occupies the center position, with troops deployed in the surrounding eight cells. As the player moves or rotates, the grid follows, maintaining tactical integrity while creating dynamic combat scenarios.

**Player Psychology**: Satisfies the desire for control and mastery through spatial reasoning and pattern recognition.

**Technical Constraints**: Grid system uses efficient data structures and can be implemented with minimal computational overhead.

**Business Alignment**: Creates endless possibilities for new troops and abilities without requiring complex new systems.
