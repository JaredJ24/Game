# Revised Backpack System for Pocket Tactics: Backpack Heroes

## Overview

The Backpack is the player's primary equipment and identity in the game. Unlike troops, which are deployed during combat, the backpack is worn exclusively by the player character. The backpack serves as the source from which troops are deployed during fight zones, and its type and customizations significantly impact the player's strategic options.

## Core Backpack Mechanics

### Backpack as Player Equipment

- The player wears a single backpack at all times
- The backpack determines which troops can be deployed and their effectiveness
- Backpacks can be switched outside of combat to adapt to different challenges
- The backpack's appearance is visible on the player character during exploration

### Troop Deployment System

- Troops are stored within the backpack and deployed during combat
- The backpack determines the maximum Energy capacity and regeneration rate
- Different backpack types have affinities with certain troop types
- Backpack abilities can support troops during combat

### Backpack Abilities

- Each backpack has passive abilities that are always active
- Active abilities can be triggered by the player during combat
- Ultimate abilities require charging through combat actions
- Abilities can affect the grid, troops, or the player character
